# NFL-Player-Style-Analysis
Full Dataset Available Here: https://www.kaggle.com/maxhorowitz/nflplaybyplay2009to2016

This project analyzes the playing style of each player, specifically quarterbacks and analyzed how each player helped his team win the match. We used the Kaggle dataset that has all the team-wise, player-wise game data and based on this data we developed a prediction system of how the playing style of a player will be based on a given scenario.

Using different techniques like, 
past data can be used to “see into the future”.
Association rule mining helps to predict a scenario based on prior features. 
Markov model prediction helps predict a scenario based on a sequence of prior plays. 
Hidden Markov model prediction helps predict a scenario and its features based on a sequence of prior features.


The Project uses the uploaded dataset in the repo

To Run the project

Clone the repo
Create a new file for whatever you are working on (Clustering, Regression, Visualization, Recommendation System, etc.)
WARNING: Running run.py will cause the scraper to run. The data has already been scraped so DO NOT run it again. it will overwrite all the contents in /Teams.
